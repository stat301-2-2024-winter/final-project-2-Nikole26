## Introduction

The project objective is to develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of small businesses or start-ups having their loan applications approved by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). This predictive model focuses on classifying loan applications into two categories: "Approved" and "Rejected," utilizing the dependent variable loan status, which indicates if the loan is either "Charged Off" or "Paid in Full".

The motivation behind this project stems from my deep curiosity in understanding the dynamics between financial institutions and emerging enterprises, particularly the challenges startups face in securing loans. As an economics undergraduate interested in applying data science skills and knowledge to real-world business scenarios, this aspect of investigating the relationship between banks and startups caught my attention. By delving into these interactions, this project provides a meaningful way for me to apply my data science expertise in economics.

Predicting loan status is a vital aspect of risk assessment for financial institutions like the SBA. Accurately identifying loans at risk of default can lead to proactive risk management and mitigation strategies. Therefore, developing a robust predictive model can aid in streamlining loan approval processes, optimizing resource allocation, and ultimately reducing the likelihood of loan defaults.

Finally, the dataset used in this project was obtained from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), publicly available on Kaggle, a platform dedicated to data science.
